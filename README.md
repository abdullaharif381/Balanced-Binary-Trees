# Balanced Binary Search Tree (AVL)

This repository contains an implementation of a Balanced Binary Search Tree (AVL) in C++. It provides operations for inserting, removing, searching, and checking if the tree is AVL balanced. The code also includes functions to print the tree in different orders and find the minimum element.

## About

This AVL tree implementation is a self-balancing binary search tree. It ensures that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one, which helps maintain efficient search and retrieval times.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this code, you need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- CMake (for building)
